# Moodle Session Extender

Tired of always re-logging in to moodle? Extend your moodle session lifetime!

## How it works

Apparently moodle has an API method to extend the lifetime of a session. If you just call this API regularly your session will never expire.

This repo features a server that does exactly that.

As a convenience feature it also features a browser extension that sends the sessions to server for continuous extension
